# Portfolio

## _The Best Portfolio, Ever_

Credit to [Stephhane Monnot] for creating this amazing portfolio that I have made some customizations of my own.

## Features

- Gitlab Contributions Graph
- Github Contributions Graph
- Achievements timeline with image carousel

## Development

For both gitlab and github contributions are displayed using react-calendar-heatmap.
The contributions for Gitlab are fetched using it's API.
The contributions for Github are fetched by scraping.

I have a server that actually gets the data. Get in touch if you need any help setting it up!
